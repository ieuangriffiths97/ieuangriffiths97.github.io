      <h5 class="hobbies-interests">Summary</h5>
      <p class="about-me-p">I am currently a 3rd Computer Science Undergraduate student at the University of Chester, with a keen area of interest in mobile application development and programming. I am still relatively new to programming, I started it for the first time in University, but I enjoy learning more and progressing my programming skills. Mobile application development interests me as I like the idea of making a program that someone will use everyday on the device they use the most. Upon graduating I hope to start a graduate programming job and build my career in the industry.</p>

          <h5 class="center">Sports</h5>
          <p class="light">I have always been into sports, I started playing football almost as soon as I could walk, so it's no surprise its my favourite sport, with my favourite team being Leeds United. I also enjoy other sports such as basketball and rugby, which I used to play in secondary school.</p>

          <p class="light">I started going to the gym when I was 16, for general health benefits. Since then I have developed a huge passion for strength training, and becoming as fit and healthy as possible. Going to the gym also keeps my mind healthy, it can be a good relief from other things in life.</p>

          <h5 class="center">Developing and Technology</h5>
          <p class="light">A relatively new, but rapidly growing interest in developing started when I began University and took on my first programming module. I still have a lot of learning ahead of me but I am eager to further my skills as a programmer. Since I started owning my own devices my inrested in new technology blossomed and I became fascinated with owning and playing with new tech</p>
